  longTourWarning: "Extended Tour Duration Warning",
  longTourExplanation: "This tour exceeds 18 hours. For tours of this length, actual completion times can vary significantly from estimates due to cumulative fatigue, psychological factors, and extended exposure to environmental conditions. Consider splitting this into multiple days.",
  dangerLevelWarning: "This tour involves high-risk conditions. Ensure proper preparation, equipment, and risk assessment before proceeding.",
  generalDisclaimer: "All calculations are estimates based on standard conditions. Actual times may vary depending on individual fitness, weather conditions, group size, and other factors not included in this basic calculation. Always plan with adequate safety margins and consult with experienced leaders for challenging tours.",
  fatigueNote: "Fatigue increases exponentially over time and can significantly impact performance, especially after 8 hours of continuous activity.",
  safetyNote: "This tool is for planning purposes only. Final decisions should always be based on current conditions, group capabilities, and sound judgment.",
  recommendedBreakNote: "Regular breaks are essential for maintaining performance. For tours over 8 hours, include adequate rest and meal breaks in your planning.",

  // Tooltips
  tooltip_packageWeight: "Weight of equipment carried. Every 5kg reduces speed by 2%. A heavier pack will significantly impact your progress over time.",
  tooltip_dangerLevel: "Environmental hazards and risks. Higher danger levels require more caution and slower progress. Extreme conditions can halve your speed.",
  tooltip_lightConditions: "Visibility conditions. Night travel reduces speed by 40% due to limited visibility. Mixed conditions (dawn/dusk) reduce speed by 20%.",
  tooltip_terrainType: "Difficulty of the terrain. Easy terrain allows normal speed, while extreme alpine conditions can reduce speed by up to 60% due to technical challenges.",
  tooltip_physicalCondition: "Current fitness level. Very fit individuals can move 20% faster than baseline, while poor condition or injuries significantly reduce speed.",
  tooltip_experienceLevel: "Technical expertise and familiarity. Experts can move 20% faster due to efficient movement and better route finding. No experience reduces speed by 40%."
